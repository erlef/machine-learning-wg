## Notes

* Bumblebee announcement: [https://news.livebook.dev/announcing-bumblebee-gpt2-stable-diffusion-and-more-in-elixir-3Op73O](https://news.livebook.dev/announcing-bumblebee-gpt2-stable-diffusion-and-more-in-elixir-3Op73O)
* José talked about the Bumblebee release, the work that was happening, the vision and what is next. The next steps include fine-tuning/transfer learning and distribution.
* Support for precompilation on [elixir_make](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir_make/blob/master/PRECOMPILATION_GUIDE.md](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir_make/blob/master/PRECOMPILATION_GUIDE.md) (thanks to Cocoa).
* Livebook updates: smarter reevaluation, doctests support, Kino Slack, and more goodies.
* Explorer v0.4.0 released with reasonably stable APIs and query support. Lazy queries next.
* Evision: they will start importing modules from OpenCV Contrib. There was a discussion on how to ship precompiled versions for them.
* ZACKY is considering the architecture of the Pelemay backend to support robust distributed and parallel computing of Nx using Node in Erlang, ensuring finite execution time by the theoretical approach. He is going to make a presentation on this at a research symposium in January.
