## Notes

*   Introductions
    *   José Valim: Interested on Nx and integration with Erlang/OTP
    *   Peer Stritzinger: Interested in the intersection Machine learning and Embedded devices, in particular inference. Especially interested in fixing the misconception that BEAM languages are no good for numerical computation.
    *   Isaac Yonemoto: Using Elixir for 3 years, all projects have been related to ML, for example: orchestrating GPU VM.  Interested in ML in general, within Elixir and outside Elixir
    *   Jason Goldberger: Wrote the Annex library for ML before Nx was a thing and is interested in Deep Learning. Working on Nx binary backend to make it more performant
    *   [Jeff Smith](https://www.jeffsmith.tech/): Spent most of the career on machine learning. Started with [Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/machine-learning-systems), then jumped into [Elixir](https://youtu.be/whtvOXZqOGM), and spent a couple years running the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) team at [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/). Focused on Deep Learning Frameworks (Axon), Interop, and Model Servers
    *   Jonatan Kłosko: Building a notebook for Elixir, still not public as the design is not ready. Focused on tooling and the ML experience
    *   Paulo Valente: Background on electronic engineering, did automatic music transcription which requires DSP. Worked on Python with Elixir to build a distributed machine learning system
    *   Robert Bates: Primary focus has been on Symbolic AI and experience with statistical machine learning. Has worked on Elixir bindings for OpenCL. Main interest are Axon and Nx
    *   Stas Versilov: Working with logistics in Elixir, started with Machine Learning a couple years ago thanks to a Coursera course. Created the Matrex library for Elixir, jumped in recently to help with Torchx
*   Machine Learning WG related PRs to Erlang/OTP
    *   [https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/4587](https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/4587)
    *   [https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/4537](https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/4537)
